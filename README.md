# [The idea](./idea.md)

## Live Site

[TicketChain](https://javierlinked-consensys.vercel.app/) **TBD: new deployment URL**


## Walkthrough Video

[Walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/876847b0e0ee43a9a0fff76a269703c1?sharedAppSource=personal_library) **TBD: new video once new site is deployed**


## To Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v16
- Yarn
- `git clone git@github.com:javierlinked/ticketchain.git`


### Contract

## Documentation under construction 


- `yarn`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn web`

- `yarn contract:test`

### Frontend
- change to `client`.
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Then navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

Application will ask to sign with your wallet.
The first account in the wallet is the **contract owner** and it's allowed to create **ticket tokens** by filling the form, and setting the price and rest of the data.

![create screeen](./create.png)

Hit create and signt with your wallet. Then wait for the transaction to be shown as an alert.

When created at least one set of tokens you can switch to another account and buy them.
Set a number to buy (it has to be less or equal to the max allowed per person) and hit buy. 
Sign the trasnaction. Payment will be performed and tokens transfered.
Balance is managed by ERC1155 contract and displayed in the UI.


**NOTE:** If you receive transaction error and you are using MetaMask, please reset your account and try again.


### Not implemented

- Owner can pause the contract. [SECURITY]
- Owner can unpause the contract. [SECURITY]
- Contract Owner see balance of already created tokens.
- Other accounts can see therir balance of already bought tokens.
- Owner can burn a token. This is the case when token is used for the show. But also is a TBD, as token can remain in buyer's wallet as a simple NFT memorabilia, which eventually could be sold in in future auctions.


### Tests - CHANGE ME

```
truffle test
```
